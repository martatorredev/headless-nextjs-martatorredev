  "After all these years working in the world of online business, I know how difficult it is to make a project succeed if you’re alone. And don’t even get me started on non-profit organizations.",
  "But fortunately, I also know how much of a difference it makes in the success of a project to be able to count on the help of others, even if they are just small contributions.",
  "Because in the end, that help turns out not to be just sand, but often comes loaded with seeds. It may seem small when you offer it, but the person who receives the help may end up with a tall and strong forest if they know how to make good use of it. 🌱",
  "I know what I’m talking about because I once received some of those seeds and now I have a freaking oasis of collaborators and projects that I’m passionate about.",
  "That’s why, since my beginnings as a developer, I’ve made it a point to reserve a little bit of my time or earnings to support non-profit organizations.",
  "Organizations that promote equality, human rights, tolerance, physical and mental health. Organizations that “plant the seeds” for a better world.",
